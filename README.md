# Beginning DevOps with Docker [eLearning]
It can be tough to roll out a pre-configured environment if you don’t know what you’re doing. We begin by guiding you through Docker from start to finish (from installation to the Docker Registry, all the way through to working with Docker Swarms). We will show you how to streamline your service options with Docker so that you can scale in an agile, responsive manner. We will also equip you with the skills you need to migrate your workflow to Docker with complete confidence. 

## What you will learn
* Understand basics of Docker and DevOps, why and how they integrate
* Design and build containers for different applications
* Set up an environment for testing, avoiding environment mismatch
* Set up and manage a multi-tier environment
* Run, debug, and experiment with applications in a container
* Build a production-ready application and host it locally

### Hardware requirements
For an optimal student experience, we recommend the following hardware configuration:
* Processor: 1.8 GHz or higher (Core 2 Duo and above)
* Memory: Minimum 2GB RAM
* Hard Disk: Minimum 10 GB

### Software requirements
You’ll also need the following software installed in advance:
* Browser: Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox (Latest updates installed)
* Docker Community Edition 17.12
* Operating System: Windows 10
